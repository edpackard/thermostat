# Thermostat Challenge

This is a thermostat application in JavaScript: it began life as a pair programming challenge as part of the Makers Academy coding bootcamp.

I worked on the backend code and tests with [William](https://github.com/Willinlondon), before continuing the challenge in my own time. I really enjoyed this project as an introduction to JavaScript.
